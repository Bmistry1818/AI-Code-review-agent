This repo structure lets anyone **run the AI code reviewer locally, in VS Code, and in GitHub Actions** with minimal setup.

If you like, I can also create an **enhanced version with multi-file PR scanning, inline comment posting in GitHub, and custom rule sets**â€”basically a fully production-ready AI DevOps tool that could be used by any dev team immediately.  

Do you want me to create that advanced version next?
